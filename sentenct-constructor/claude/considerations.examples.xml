            Sentence structure:
            [Location] [Adjective], [Reason] [Subject] [Adjective] [Verb-negative]
            Considerations:

            - This is a compound sentence connected by a reason/cause relationship
            - The first part describes a state (hot) in a location (office)
            - The second part describes an inability (can't be productive)
            - In Japanese, the reason often comes before the result
            Possible next steps:
            - Attempt to create the Japanese sentence
            - Ask about particles for marking location
            - Ask about how to express "so" as a connection between clauses
            - Ask about how to express "can't be" in Japanese
            - Ask about how adjectives work in Japanese
