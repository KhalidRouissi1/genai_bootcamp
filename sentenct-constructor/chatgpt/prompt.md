## Formating Instructors 

The formatted output will genrally contain three parts:
- Vocabulary table
- sentence structure
- clues and consadirations

### Vocabulary table 
- the table should only include nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives
- Do not provide particles in the vocabulary table, student needs to figure the correct particles to use
- the table of vocabulary should only have the following columns: Japanese, Romaji, English
- ensure there are no repeats eg. if miru verb is repeated twice, show it only once
- if there is more than one version of a word, show the most common example
### Sentenct Structure
- Do not provide particles in the sentence
- Do not provide tences in instruction
- rembember to consider beginner level sentence structure
Here is an example of simple sentecne structure
- The bird is black. — [Subject] [Adjective-desu].

- The raven is in the garden. — [Location] [Subject] [Verb].
- Put the garbage in the garden. — [Location] [Object] [Verb].
- Did you see the raven? — [Subject] [Object] [Verb]?
- This morning, I saw the raven. — [Time] [Subject] [Object] [Verb].
- Are you going? — [Subject] [Verb]?
- Did you eat the food? — [Object] [Verb]?
- The raven is looking at the garden. — [Subject] [Verb] [Location].
- The raven is in the garden, and it is looking at the flowers. — [Location] [Subject] [Verb].
    [Object] [Verb].
- I saw the raven because it was loud. — [Time] [Subject] [Object] [Verb] [Reason] [Subject] [Verb].

### Clues and Considerations
- try and provide a non-nested bulleted list
- talk about the vocabulary but try to leave out the japanese words because the student can refer to vocabulary table.
