        -BAD: In the vocabulary table it not show the japanese character, the celss are just one or more of those 外.
        -BAD: the beginning sentenc is uncessaryn should just jump in showing the vocabulary table  
        -BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student should figure that out. 
        -BAD: The sentence structure is saying too much we really want someting coceptual like this: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Let's work on transcribing the sentence into Japanese. Here's a table of vocabulary to help you get started:
    | Japanese | Romaji | English |
    | くま | kuma | bear |
    | 門 | mon | door |
    | ごみ | gomi |	garbage |
    | 外 | soto | outside |
    Possible sentence structure: (Topic) + (Location) + (Object) + (Question)
    Clue: The sentence can be broken down into two parts: stating the location of the bears and asking about the garbage. Think about how to use the vocabulary to form two connected sentences.
    How would you like to proceed? Do you want to try forming the sentence or ask for more clues?

    | door | ドア | Noun |
    | garbage | ゴミ | Noun |
    | to be (location) | いる | Intransitive Ichidan Verb |
    | to leave | 出す（だす）| Transitive Godan Verb |

    Sentence structure:
    [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
    - The first part is stating a location where something exists
    - The second part is asking about a past action

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation
