2. Use Step-by-Step Instructions

3. Assign a Role to GPT

‚ùå "Give me business ideas."

4. Specify Output Format

9. Use System Messages for Behavior Control

For API users, you can set a system message to guide behavior:
python

messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a sarcastic but knowledgeable tech expert."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Explain blockchain like I'm 5."}
]

10. Test & Refine Prompts

If the output isn‚Äôt perfect, tweak:

    Add more details

    Change phrasing

    Ask GPT to critique its own response ("How can this answer be improved?")

Bonus: Advanced Techniques

    Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting: Ask GPT to explain reasoning step-by-step.
    *"Solve this math problem: If 3x + 5 = 20, what is x? Show your work."*

    Self-Critique: "Review this code for errors and suggest optimizations."

    Multi-Turn Dialogue: Break complex tasks into follow-up questions.
